# Hi from my [slides](https://slides.yazgan.xyz)!

You can see my slides at [slides.yazgan.xyz](https://slides.yazgan.xyz).

## Development

To run the slides locally:
- Clone the repository
- `cd` into the repository
- `npm install`
- Slidev default file is "slides.md". So you need to select and change one of my slides which starts with "slides-" and ends with ".md" to "slides.md". Then continue with the following steps.
- `npm run dev`
- visit <http://localhost:3030>
